### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Haojie. Currently, I am an algorithm expert at [Kuaishou Technology](https://www.kuaishou.com/), leading the project [Kuaipedia](https://github.com/ScarletPan/Kuaipedia), which is the first large-scale multi-modal short-video encyclopedia in the world. Before that, I am an senior algorithm engineer at [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/), developing large scale NLP toolkits on [PAI](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/machine-learning?spm=a2c65.11461447.0.0.25e81730czH1UY) . I got my Mphil. degree from [HKUST](http://www.ust.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). I received my B.E. degree at ZJU in June 2018, supervised by [Prof. Deng Cai](http://dengcai.zjulearning.org:8081/).
